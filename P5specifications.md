# P5 Specifications
---

- External dependencies: pandas (recommended). Therefore, we'll need a local virtual environment for our project. 
- We also use sqlite3 from the Python Standard Library.
- Practice key skills is recommended to help learn the process for best results.

### sql_create folder:
- 01_drop_tables.sql - drop tables to restart
- 02_create_tables.sql - create your database schema using sql
- 03_insert_records.sql - insert at least 10 additional records into each table.

### sql_features folder:

- update_records.sql - update 1 or more records in a table.
